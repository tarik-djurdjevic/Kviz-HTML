# Quiz Website with JSON Generator

This repository contains:

- A Python script (`generator-pitanja.py`) to extract questions and answers from Word documents and convert them into a JSON format required for the website.
- A static website that displays the quiz with basic functionalities built using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

1. **Automated JSON Generation**:

   - The questions and answers are extracted from Word documents using the provided Python script.
   - This eliminates the need for manual insertion of questions and answers.
   - The script processes the Word document and outputs a JSON file instantly, enabling rapid quiz generation.

2. **Static Website**:
   - A simple website built in vanilla JavaScript to display the quiz.
   - Basic functionalities include rendering questions, capturing answers, and showing results.

## Data Source

The questions and answers were sourced from: [Dr≈æavni Ispit Questions](https://drzavni-ispit.foto55.com/ispitna%20pitanja.html).

## How It Works

1. Run the Python script (`generator-pitanja.py`) to generate the JSON file from a Word document.
2. Place the generated JSON file in the appropriate location for the website.
3. Open the static website to take the quiz using the new set of questions and answers.

## Benefits

- Quickly generate new quizzes with minimal effort.
- A tool designed for easier learning, built to streamline the process of studying for exams.
